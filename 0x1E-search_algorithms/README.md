## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Linear search**
  * [0-linear.c](./0-linear.c): C function that searches for a value in an array
  of integers using linear search.
  * If the value is not present or the array is `NULL`, returns `-1`.
	* Otherwise, returns the first index where `value` is located.

* **1. Binary search**
  * [1-binary.c](./1-binary.c): C function that searches for a value in a sorted
  array of integers using binary search.
  * Assumes the array is sorted in ascending order and that the value to search
  for is not repeated in the array.
  * If the value is not present or the array is `NULL`, returns `-1`.
	* Otherwise, returns the index where `value` is located.

* **2. Big O #0**
  * [2-O](./2-O): Text file containing the worst case time complexity of linear
  search.

* **3. Big O #1**
  * [3-O](./3-O): Text file containing the worst case space complexity of
  iterative linear search.

* **4. Big O #2**
  * [4-O](./4-O): Text file containing worst case case time complexity
  of binary search.

* **5. Big O #3**
  * [5-O](./5-O): Text file containing the worst case space complexity
  of binary search.

* **6. Big O #4**
  * [6-O](./6-O): Text file containing the space complexity of the following algorithm:
